Part1. Simulation of a two-pass linker that performs relocation of external addresses and resolves external symbol references.
Part2. Discrete event simulation of first-come-first-served (FCFS), last-come-first-served (LCFS), shortest-job-first (SJF), round-robin (RR), priority (PRIO) and preemptive-priority(PREPRIO) CPU scheduling algorithms.
Part3. Discrete event simulation of FIFO, second-chance, random, enhanced-second-chance (NRU), clock, aging and working-set page replacement algorithms to map virtual addresses of multiple processes onto physical frames.
Part4. Simulation of scheduling IO requests via FIFO, shortest seek time first (SSTF), LOOK, CLOOK, and FLOOK algorithms
